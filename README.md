**hi, i'm veit.**

i'm a technologist at large in erlangen, germany.
i work independently at the intersection of **developer experience**, **programming languages**, and **technical due diligence**.
i also have vast experience in **security** and **networking**, where i spend a lot of my professional engagements.

i live for expressive systems and delightful abstractions. this has often led
me to lisp and smalltalk.

##### currently

i’m working on security & network automation tools over at [cyberwitchery labs](https://cyberwitchery.com/). check [the blog](https://cyberwitchery.com/log/) or
find the work [on github](https://github.com/cyberwitchery/). for instance, check out [alembic](https://github.com/cyberwitchery/alembic) for a model-driven
dcim/ipam tool, or [familiar](https://github.com/cyberwitchery/familiar) for a simple llm workflow orchestrator.

##### projects & contributions

- [**glamorous toolkit**](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit): a moldable development environment.
  i contribute to the core, build the llm integration (gt4llm), documentation, and various language integrations.
- [**carp**](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp): a statically typed lisp for realtime applications.
  i contributed the macro system as well as various core macros (`setf`, quasiquoting, string formatting etc.), stdlib things, and compiler ergonomics.
  you can find more of my work over at [the carpentry](https://github.com/carpentry-org).

##### experiments

- [**sbcli**](https://github.com/hellerve/sbcli): a repl for sbcl that doesn’t suck. built to improve my interactive lisp experience outside of an editor.
- [**microml**](https://github.com/hellerve/microml): a minimalist ml-style language compiler and interpreter in under 750 lines of python.
- [**mae**](https://github.com/hellerve/mae): maps are everything.
- [**compfuck**](https://github.com/hellerve/compfuck): a brainfuck compiler written in carp macros that runs entirely at compile time.
  an exploration of compile-time evaluation and language minimalism. if you’re fancy, think of it as futamura projections.
- [**cspfuck**](https://github.com/hellerve/cspfuck): brainfuck with actors, written in c, without dependencies, with a x86 jit.
- [**cj**](https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj): a dependency-free jit framework for c, with backends for x86 and arm64.

##### what i care about

- systems that are moldable, inspectable, and useful
- tooling that respects our time and attention
- speaking & writing about the things we do, because i love teaching & learning
