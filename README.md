# hi, i'm veit

i'm an technologist at large in erlangen, germany.
i work indepdently at the intersection of **developer experience**, **programming languages**, and **technical due diligence**.
i also have vast experience in **security** and **networking**.

i live for expressive systems and delightful abstractions. that has often led
me to lisp and smalltalk, but not always.

## projects & contributions

- [**glamorous toolkit**](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit): a moldable development environment.
  i contribute to the core, built the llm integration (gt4llm), documentation, and various language integrations.

- [**carp**](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp): a statically typed lisp for realtime applications.
  i contributed the macro system as well as various core macros (`setf`, quasiquoting, inline C and assembly), standard tooling, and compiler ergonomics.
  you can find more of my work over at [the carpentry](https://github.com/carpentry-org).

### experiments

- [**sbcli**](https://github.com/hellerve/sbcli): a simple repl for sbcl with command introspection, history, and readline support.
  i built it to improve my interactive lisp experience outside of an editor.

- [**microml**](https://github.com/hellerve/microml): a minimalist ml-style language with a complete compiler and interpreter in under 750 lines of python.

- [**mae**](https://github.com/hellerve/mae): maps are everything.

- [**compfuck**](https://github.com/hellerve/compfuck): a brainfuck compiler written in carp macros that runs entirely at compile time.
  an exploration of compile-time evaluation and language minimalism. if youâ€™re fancy, think of it as futamura projections.

- [**cspfuck**](https://github.com/hellerve/cspfuck): brainfuck with actors, written in c, without dependencies, with a x86 jit.

- [**anima.carp**](https://github.com/hellerve/anima.carp): a small animation and drawing framework for carp.
  a sketching tool i built to show off carp.

## what i care about

- systems that are moldable, inspectable, and useful
- tooling that respects our time and attention
- speaking & writing about the things we do, because i love teaching & learning
